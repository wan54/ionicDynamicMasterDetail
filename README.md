ionicDynamicMasterDetail
========================

Dynamic master detail layout powered by ionic framework.

This [demo](http://wan54.github.io/ionicDynamicMasterDetail) is using Sidemenu (dynamic too) and Navigation.

The same templates used for tablets will be reusable on phones.

Simply add platform ios/android after you get the source and run/emulate.

On the browser try on on Chrome with device mode turned on.

The only condition that the directive requires is `<ion-view>` must be the first element in master and detail templates.

There are two custom directives:

- `dynamic-md-layout` enables dynamic master detail layout.
- `should-expose-when` enables the sidemenu to be automatically hidden when opening sub contents from the main page.

The demo and codes are self-explanatory.
